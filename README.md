Data Structures
=====================

## Huffman

The huffman tree used for compressing files. I have created tree.c which has the main methods for dealing with the individual nodes as well as creating/destroying the tree. It was done for a project in my COEN 12 class at Santa Clara University.

## Trees

Minheap: Implemented a minheap (utilizes vector class in STL).

Maxheap: Implemented a maxheap (utilizes vector class in STL).

Binary: Implemented a binary tree and Binary Search Tree by inheriting from the Binary Tree.

## Stacks

Implemented a very generic stack in Java using generics

## Linked Lists

Implementation of a singly linked list in Java (with a private node class)
